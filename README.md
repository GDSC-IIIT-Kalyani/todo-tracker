## **Requirements** :-
Python 3.\*

Ubuntu

## Instructions

1. Make run.sh executable with `chmod +x`
2. Go to Settings > Keyboard Bindings
3. Add a new binding of you choice. I use `Alt+/` and put the path of the executable like `path/to/folder/./run.sh` . This will run the code when you press that binding
