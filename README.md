# CUI program to easily add and schedule tasks on the go

This is some python code which is linked with a bash script which can be executed by just using a keystroke.

## **Requirements** :-
Python 3.\*

Ubuntu

## Instructions

1. Make run.sh executable with `chmod +x`
2. Go to Settings > Keyboard Bindings
3. Add a new binding of you choice. I use `Alt+/` and put the path of the executable like `path/to/folder/./run.sh` . This will run the code when you press that binding

When the window opens, you have to write the commands as `<command> <arg1> <arg2>...`
Currently available commands are 

1. store
2. delete
3. purge
4. show
